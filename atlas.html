    <h2>The Company</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="bodytext">
    <p>In the midst of rising expectations and the pressure to succeed, depression amongst college students is a growing issue. Atlas
      is an iOS app my team and I designed to help clinically depressed college students manage their mental
       health.<br><br> Atlas is centered around Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), one of the most common forms of treatment for depression. This strategy aims to identify activities associated with negative thought patterns and re-evaluate them in light of reality. With Atlas, the student works with
         their therapist to identify these difficult tasks and strives to accomplish them through the support of friends and family.</p>

      </div>
  </div>
  <div class="bodytext">
    <p>Based on initial interviews with patients and therapists, we identified two interrelated problems. First, students are very busy
       and therapists see a lot of patients, so it can often take weeks for a new therapy session to get scheduled. We needed to think
       of a way to help bridge the gap between patient and therapist.<br><br>The second problem stemmed from the first. Therapists need more
        data to provide value to their patients, especially when they are not physically present.</p>

      <h2>Depression and CBT Research</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="bodytext">
      <p>To get a better understanding of the space we were designing for, we conducted general research on depression, specifically amongst college
        students. One resource I found to be particularly educational was Stanford Professor Robert
         Sapolsky's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=NOAgplgTxfc" target="_blank">presentation</a> on depression in the U.S.<br><br>A large part of our research was focused on learning about
         different types of coping mechanisms that exist for depression, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. CBT became the core form of treatment used in our app.</p>

      <p>Our next step in the research phase was to put together an anonymous <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdVBJay78UnEgj2fPHS78rOtcpgFykc4ar6nobjFs60QNHnug/viewform?c=0&w=1here"
       target="_blank"> survey</a> to collect information on how college students cope with their depression. In addition to the survey, we conducted phone interviews with a couple students
          and therapists who were willing to share their thoughts and experiences surrounding depression.<br><br> One of the key questions we asked in the survey was
            'How do you manage your depression?' This was a multiple choice question that strongly influenced the main treatment
             strategies we chose to incorporate into the app's design.</p>

      <p>As shown above, the top two responses were 'Medication' and 'Therapy'. However, these forms of therapy were out of our
         control, since we were designing an app. We decided to focus on the responses in orange, which were 'Social
          Methods' and 'Journaling'.

        <p>Our next task was to begin defining the visual brand of Atlas. We started off the session by pinning up around 70
          images on the wall and having the founder indicate whether or not he felt the images captured the personality of Atlas.
          We had him place green stickers on the images he liked and red stickers on those that didn't resonate with him:

        <p>We then had the founder describe what he envisioned Atlas to look and feel like for users. Based on his description,

      <p>Throughout Lo-Fi and Hi-Fi phases, we conducted several rounds of usability tests and interviews to gain a better understanding
      of both student and therapist needs. Here are the four main points of feedback we received:</p>
  </div>

  <div id="generic">
    <h3>Students</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="bodytext">
      <ol>
        <li style="list-style-position:inside";>Gamification could help motivate people more to use the app</li>
        <li style="list-style-position:inside";>Confirming a task can be simplified</li>

  <div class="bodytext">
      <ol>
        <li style="list-style-position:inside";>Need to protect the user's confidential information</li>
        <li style="list-style-position:inside";>Weekly/monthly task completion averages would be useful data</li>
      </ol>
  </div>
  <div id="user_testing">
    <h3>I. Gamification</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="hero">

      </div>
  </div>
  <div class="bodytext">
      <p>We decided to gamify Atlas by designing a flower that grows each time the user completes a task. When they finish all tasks
         for a given day, the flower gets added to their Garden, which can be accessed through the hamburger menu. </p>
  </div>
  <div id="user_testing">
    <h3>II. Confirming a Task</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="hero">
      <div id="medium">
        <img src="student_2.png"/>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div class="bodytext">
      <p>We timed users to see how long it took for them to confirm a completed a task. Initially, there was some extra cognitive load
         we put on users by asking them to choose between photo and location confirmation. We removed this choice and
         automatically routed them to the most appropriate confirmation method.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="user_testing">
    <h3>III. Confidentiality</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="hero">
      <div id="medium">
        <img src="therapist_1.png"/>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div class="bodytext">
      <p>Confidentiality was an issue brought up by one of the therapists we spoke with. We decided to secure the user’s information by adding
         an iOS-style passcode screen to open the app. </p>
  </div>
  <div id="user_testing">
    <h3>IV. Task Completion Averages</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="hero">
      <div id="medium">
        <img src="therapist_2.png"/>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div class="bodytext">
      <p>Lastly, since therapists would be using the app primarily for the data, it was interesting to hear their thoughts around what other types
         of information they’d find useful. They wanted to see weekly and monthly averages for task completion, so we decided to create a card system
          showing average completion per task and for all tasks over a given period of time.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="bodytext">
      <p>I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to fully design the first generation of Atlas. As I came to learn, mental
         health is a very challenging space to design for. Unfortunately, mental health is still surrounded by a great deal of
         negative stigma, introducing many constraints on the social features of our app. Understandably, HIPPA privacy laws
         also provided a barrier against easily accessing our target audience for interviews.<br><br> Perhaps the greatest challenge;
         however, was the need to design for individuals who are not particularly inclined to use the app in the first place.
         We were designing for people to recover as quickly as possible and stop using the app, rather than utilize it for
         an extended period of time. This meant we needed to create a light, cheerful platform that limited any additional
         burden that depressed students need to carry.<br><br> I hope that by addressing these challenges, my team and I were able
         to make a meaningful impact on students coping with depression. I'm very excited to see where our clients will
         take Atlas next!</p><br><br>
